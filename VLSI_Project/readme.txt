project_KNN.py uses KNN algorithm to detect a hardware trojan.
The input of project_KNN.py is ROFreq which from 'Chip 1.xlsx' to 'Chip 33.xlsx'
The output of project_KNN.py is two figures and three tables.
Figure 1 is 'Average Training Time and Evaluation Time', 
Figure 2 is 'Accuracy Rate(%) comparison for training size = 6, 12, 24'
table 1('6.csv') is 4*24 which include Avg, SD, Max, Min Accuracy of TF, T1-T23 for train size =6
table 2('12.csv') is 4*24 which include Avg, SD, Max, Min Accuracy of TF, T1-T23 for train size =12
table 3('24.csv') is 4*24 which include Avg, SD, Max, Min Accuracy of TF, T1-T23 for train size =24
