# sha256 #

## Implementation status ##
The core has been completed for a long time and been used in several
designs in ASICs as well as in FPGAs. The core is considered mature and
ready for use. Minor changes are non-functional cleanups of code.


## Introduction
Hardware implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function with
support for both SHA-256 and SHA-224. The implementation is written in
Verilog 2001 compliant code. The implementation includes the main core
as well as wrappers that provides interfaces for simple integration.

This is a low area implementation that iterates over the rounds but
there is no sharing of operations such as adders.

The hardware implementation is complemented by a functional model
written in Python.

Note that the core does **NOT** implement padding of final block. The
caller is expected to handle padding.

The core supports and has been included in the
[FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) package manager.



## Implementation details ##
The sha256 design is divided into the following sections.
- src/rtl - RTL source files
- src/tb  - Testbenches for the RTL files
- src/model/python - Functional model written in python
- doc - documentation (currently not done.)
- toolruns - Where tools are supposed to be run. Includes a Makefile for
building and simulating the design using
[Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/). There are also targets
for linting the core using [Verilator](http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator).

The actual core consists of the following files:
- sha256_core.v - The core itself with wide interfaces.
- sha256_w_mem.v - W message block memory and block expansion logic.
- sha256_k_constants.v - K constants ROM memory.

The top level entity is called sha256_core. This entity has wide
interfaces (512 bit block input, 256 bit digest). In order to make it
usable you probably want to wrap the core with a bus interface.


The provided top level wrapper, sha256.v provides a simple 32-bit memory
like interface. The core (sha256_core) will sample all data inputs when
given the init or next signal. the wrapper contains additional data
registers. This allows you to load a new block while the core is
processing the previous block.


The core supports both sha224 and sha256 modes. The default mode is
sha256. The mode bit is located in the ADDR_CTRL API register and this
means that when writing to this register to start processing a block,
care must be taken to set the mode bit to the intended mode. This means
that old code that for example simply wrote 0x01 to initiate SHA256
processing will now initiate SHA224 processing. Writing 0x05 will
now initiate SHA256 processing.

Regarding SHA224, it is up to the user to only read seven, not eight
words from the digest registers. The core will update the LSW too.


## Streaming interface ##
There is a streaming interface for the core contributed by
[Olof Kindgren](https://github.com/olofk).

- src/interfaces/stream/rtl - RTL source file for wrapped core
- src/interfaces/stream/tb - Testbench for the wrapped core


## AXI4 interface ##

**NOTE** This interface is currently being developed. Expect bugs as this
interface is still under development.

There is now an AXI4 interface for the core contributed by
[Sanjay A Menon](https://github.com/Sanjay-A-Menon). The interface wraps
sha256_core, replacing sha256.v

The interface provides an AXI4-Lite slave interface with added hash
complete interrupt signal. Chip select is implemented via axi_awprot
signal.
